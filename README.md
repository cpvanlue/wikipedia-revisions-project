## Wikipedia Revisions Search Tool
### A project by Caleb Van Lue, Hailey Leonard, and Monika Krcoski

## Description
This project pulls data from the Wikipedia API requesting the 20 most recent changes made to any given Wikipedia page. The program displays the username and timestamp of each recent revision. If any redirects are used when searching for a page, the user is notified. If no page exists for a searched term or if no network connection can be established, the user is notified. All communications with the user at this version (0.2) are through the Graphical User Interface. User can select whether they would like to see the 20 most recent revisions, or the most edits.

## In order to run the program, utilize the main method inside of the Main class. 
If user would like to switch between view of edits or editors, they must change their selection and search again. 

Program last pushed with Java JDK 14.0.2,
Gradle JVM 11.0.5 and JavaFX 15. Build with these for best functionality.

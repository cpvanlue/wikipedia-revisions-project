This project pulls data from the Wikipedia API requesting
the 20 most recent changes made to any given Wikipedia page.
The program displays the username and timestamp of each 
recent revision. If any redirects are used when 
searching for a page, the user is notified. If no page exists
for a searched term or if no network connection can be established,
the user is notified. All communications with the user at this version
(0.1) are through the console. 

In order to run the program, utilize the main method inside of the UserInterface class. 

Program last pushed with Java JDK 14.0.2 and
Gradle JVM 11.0.5. Build with these for best functionality.
